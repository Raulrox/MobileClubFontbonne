Android Mobile Programming Club Website Scenario:
Bob, a student in the mobile programming class, wanted to check out the programming club website after he heard all students in the class automatically became members. He did a web search for Fontbonne mobile programming and it was the first site to pop up. When he clicked the link, it brought him to the home screen with the clubs mission. At the top right corner, he saw a sign in tab and decided to click on it. When he did, it asked for the username and password he was given. Once entered, he was brought back to the home screen. He noticed another tab at the top of the page that would lead him to the blog. He wanted to see what other club member had posted so he proceeded to click on that tab. As he scrolled through the posts he saw many tutorials as well as student questions that he thought may be useful in the future. He also noticed that many of the answers that were posted seemed very helpful and decided he would make sure to post any questions he encountered throughout the semester. Before signing off, Bob looked at his profile and updated some of the missing information. After doing that, he logged out and closed the site.
