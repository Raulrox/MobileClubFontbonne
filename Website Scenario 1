Android Mobile Programming Club Website Scenario:

A student named Alice heard about the mobile programming club and decided to check out the website. After opening the web page and reading the clubs mission, she decided to view some of the apps the club had previously designed. After seeing what the club had done, she became interested. Not realizing she had to be in the mobile programming class to become a member of the club and have an account on the site, she decided to try to create an account for herself. When she couldnâ€™t find where to do that, she went to the contact page and emailed one of the members about how to join the club.
